Eventho, he managed to be a student in the Engineering School of the Universidad NAcional Autonoma de Mexico and be part of the High Performance Alumni Program (PARA in spanish). In his later school years, he was part of the Mechatronics Research Group (MRG) where he worked on a project of autonomous robotics seeking for the convergent and organic merge of artificial intelligence and intuition, under the charge of the PhD_Felipe Rivas_ and _Javier Gonzales Villela_, obtainting outsatnding results (obvio si, obvio si osi).\nAhora lo que venia a ver como se ve\nNelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.\nY pos un lorem pal test, si? Por que no?
